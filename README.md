## Overview

Shopikart is a playful e-commerce app built with Django that offers a comprehensive platform for users to buy and sell products. The app provides a user-friendly interface with features like product reviews and ratings, the ability to list products for sale, and a cart functionality that allows users to add and manage their selected items. Shopikart also features a wishlist function for users to save their desired products for future reference.

This application was initially developed as a project for the "[CS50's Web Programming with Python and JavaScript course](https://cs50.harvard.edu/web/2020/)" course offered by Harvard University. Since then, it has undergone several enhancements and modifications to incorporate a wider range of features.

## Difficulties

Developing the Cart page and the Update Cart function proved to be the most challenging aspect of creating Shopikart. This was due to the complexity of the feature and the numerous client-side and server-side validations that had to be implemented, especially for product quantity validations. Additionally, a significant amount of DOM manipulation was required to ensure that the user interface was intuitive and easy to use.

## Overcoming Challenges

To overcome challenges faced during the development of the project, I made use of my previous project, SocialFront, as a reference point. This helped me to efficiently and effectively create the necessary API endpoints in Django to be used with Fetch in JavaScript. The goal was to display and save the correct data without having to refresh the page. This approach saved a significant amount of development time and ensured a smooth development process.

## Conclusion

To conclude, this project helped me enhance my Django and JavaScript skills by gaining even more practical experience working with JavaScript's fetch method as well working with creating API Endpoints in my `views.py`.
